# Running our AI Agent
Our agent requires no external tools or libraries.
To run our agent, you need to create an Alpha-Beta-Agent object from the alpha-beta-agent class in alpha_beta_agent.py file.
Once the agent is created, you can call go, passing in the board state, and the function will return the column it chooses.
